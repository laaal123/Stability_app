âœ… Current Capabilities (Already Implemented)
ðŸ’Š Product Metadata Logging

Capture product name, batch number, batch size, packaging mode.

ðŸ“ˆ Stability Data Input

Add Assay, Dissolution, Impurities, or any custom parameter.

Enter results across time points (Initial to 24M).

Assign specs (e.g., NLT 80%, NMT 0.5%).

ðŸŸ  Automatic Evaluation

Out-of-spec (OOS) values are auto-flagged (red).

Trendline regression for visual prediction.

Spec limits plotted for visual compliance.

ðŸ“¤ Reporting

Download full reports as:

ðŸ§¾ Excel (with formatted tables + embedded charts)

ðŸ“„ PDF (summary + plots per condition)

ðŸš€ What More Can You Do With This Project?
1. ðŸ“Š Shelf-Life Estimation (Retest Date)
Use regression models to project when Assay/Impurity will hit limits.

Predict time to failure â†’ calculate tentative shelf-life.

2. ðŸ“¦ Packaging Comparison
Input same batch under multiple packs (e.g., Blister vs Bottle).

Compare parameter degradation across conditions.

3. ðŸ“¡ Integration with LIMS or ELN
Connect to lab systems via API or CSV to pull real test data automatically.

4. ðŸ§  AI Insights
Use ML to flag abnormal degradation patterns.

Train models to predict out-of-trend (OOT) or OOS behavior.

5. ðŸ“ˆ Trend Monitoring Dashboard
Host the app and track all stability studies in a dashboard format.

Show % deviation from target spec over time.

6. ðŸ“‹ Regulatory Audit-Ready
Generate FDA/ICH-compliant reports.

Archive every study version with timestamp.

7. ðŸ“§ Auto-Alerts
Add logic to send email alerts if:

Assay drops below limit

Impurity crosses threshold

Retest date is close
